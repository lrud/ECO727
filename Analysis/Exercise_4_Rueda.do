*regression and joint statistical significance
regress lrwage grade experience exp2
testparm experience exp2

// Note the concace relatiionship b/t exp2 and lrwage. exp2 coef. is negative. p-value==0 as well

*display to find exp val where f'=0
display -(_b[experience]) / (2 * _b[exp2]) //about 41 years

***end part b

*secondary regression to include race, region, occupation, industry and year effects and joint s.s test
