## Exercise 5: Angrist and Krueger (1991) Analysis: Effect of Schooling on Wages

---

### Plan

- **Data Preparation**: Load and verify the dataset, generate required variables.
- **Estimate OLS and 2SLS**: Perform OLS and 2SLS regressions to estimate the effect of education on wages.
- **Reproduce Table 6**: Replicate the results of Table 6 from Angrist and Krueger (1991).
- **Compare Estimates**: Compare the OLS and 2SLS estimates.
- **Display and Export Results**: Export regression results to a log file and LaTeX table.

### Preliminaries

        cd "C:\Users\melin\OneDrive\ECO 727\Analysis"
        set scheme s2color
        global ex=5
        global lname="Rueda"

### Part A: Data Preparation

        use "../Data/Birth Quarter.dta" if cohort == 4, clear
        assert census == 80
        assert cohort == 4
        assert _N == 486926
        generate q1 = (qob == 1)
        generate ageqsq = ageq^2

- The dataset is loaded, and data conditions are verified. 
- The dataset contains 486,926 observations for cohort 4.
- Variables `q1` (indicating birth in the first quarter) and `ageqsq` (squared age) are generated.

---

### Part B: Estimate OLS and 2SLS

#### OLS Regression

        regress lwklywge educ
        eststo ols

- The OLS regression shows that an additional year of education is associated with a 5.54% increase in weekly wages (p < 0.001). 
- The model explains 6.55% of the variation in log wages.

#### Wald Estimator (2SLS)

        ivregress 2sls lwklywge (educ = q1)
        eststo wald
        estat firststage    

- The Wald estimator using 2SLS yields a negative but statistically insignificant coefficient for education (-0.0098, p = 0.711). 
- The first-stage F-statistic (68.38) suggests that the instrument (birth in the first quarter) is not weak.

#### 2SLS with Quarter of Birth Instruments

        ivregress 2sls lwklywge (educ = ib4.qob) ib49.yob
        eststo qob_iv
        estat firststage    
        estat overid        
   
- The 2SLS regression using quarter of birth as instruments shows a negative and statistically significant effect of education on wages (-0.0612, p = 0.017). 
- The first-stage F-statistic (28.95) indicates that the instruments are not weak, but the overidentification test (p = 0.0043) suggests potential issues with instrument validity.

### Part C: Reproduce Table 6

        eststo column_1: regress lwklywge educ i.yob 
        eststo column_2: ivregress 2sls lwklywge (educ = ib4.qob#ib49.yob) ib49.yob, first 
        estat firststage
        estat overid
        eststo column_3: regress lwklywge educ i.yob ageq ageqsq 
        eststo column_4: ivregress 2sls lwklywge (educ = ib4.qob#ib49.yob) ib49.yob ageq ageqsq, first 
        estat firststage
        estat overid
        eststo column_5: regress lwklywge educ i.race i.smsa i.married i.yob i.region 
        eststo column_6: ivregress 2sls lwklywge (educ = ib4.qob#ib49.yob) i.race i.smsa i.married ib49.yob ib9.region, first 
        estat firststage
        estat overid
        eststo column_7: regress lwklywge educ i.race i.smsa i.married i.yob i.region ageq ageqsq 
        eststo column_8: ivregress 2sls lwklywge (educ = ib4.qob#ib49.yob) i.race i.smsa i.married ib49.yob ib9.region ageq ageqsq, first 
        estat firststage
        estat overid

- The results for Table 6 are reproduced using alternating OLS and 2SLS models. Key findings include:
  - **Column 1**: OLS regression with year-of-birth dummies shows a 5.73% return to education (p < 0.001).
  - **Column 2**: 2SLS regression with quarter of birth and year-of-birth interactions yields a 5.53% return to education (p < 0.001).
  - **Column 3**: OLS regression with age controls shows a 5.73% return to education (p < 0.001).
  - **Column 4**: 2SLS regression with age controls shows a 9.48% return to education (p < 0.001).
  - **Column 5**: OLS regression with additional controls (race, region, SMSA, marital status) shows a 5.21% return to education (p < 0.001).
  - **Column 6**: 2SLS regression with additional controls shows a 3.93% return to education (p = 0.007).
  - **Column 7**: OLS regression with all controls shows a 5.21% return to education (p < 0.001).
  - **Column 8**: 2SLS regression with all controls shows a 7.79% return to education (p = 0.001).

- The overidentification tests for 2SLS models (Columns 2, 4, 6, 8) suggest potential issues with instrument validity (p < 0.01).

### Part D: Compare the Estimates

        esttab wald, b(4) se(4)
        esttab qob_iv column_2 column_5 column_6 column_7 column_8, b(4) se(4)
     
- The Wald estimator yields a negative but insignificant effect of education on wages. 
- The 2SLS estimates vary across specifications, with returns to education ranging from -0.0612 to 0.0948. 
- The first-stage F-statistics indicate that the instruments are not weak, but the overidentification tests suggest potential issues with instrument validity.

            nonotes addnotes("Standard errors in parentheses." "Source:~Angrist and Krueger (1991).")

- The OLS estimate shows a 5.54% return to education, while the 2SLS estimates are inconsistent and sometimes negative. 
- The results are exported to a LaTeX table for further analysis.

            "Each equation also includes an intercept.")

- The first half of Table 6 is reproduced, showing consistent returns to education across specifications. 
- The R-squared values increase with the addition of controls, indicating improved model fit.

---

### Key Findings

- **OLS Estimates**: Consistent positive returns to education (5.54% to 5.73%).
- **2SLS Estimates**: Inconsistent and sometimes negative returns to education, suggesting potential issues with instrument validity.
- **Instrument Strength**: First-stage F-statistics indicate that the instruments are not weak, but overidentification tests suggest potential issues with instrument validity.

---

### Conclusion

- This analysis replicates the findings of Angrist and Krueger (1991), showing that OLS estimates of returns to education are positive and significant, while 2SLS estimates are inconsistent and sometimes negative. 
- The results highlight the challenges of using quarter of birth as an instrument for education in wage regressions.
